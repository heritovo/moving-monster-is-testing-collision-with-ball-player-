# moving-monster-is-testing-collision-with-ball-player-
This online example uses the game framework (without time-based animation in this one). We just added a "player" (for the moment, a circle that follows the mouse cursor), and a "monster". We created two JavaScript objects for describing the monster and the player, and these objects both have a boundingCircleRadius property:

Move your cursor to move the player ball. Move the monster using the gaming keys "WASD" for respective "up, left, down, and right" movements. When you hit the monster with you player ball (cursor), everything will turn red! Be careful!! LOL!
